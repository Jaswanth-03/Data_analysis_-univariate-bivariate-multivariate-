# Univariate Analysis for Categorical Column

This section focuses on conducting univariate analysis on categorical columns.

### Frequency Distribution
- Provides a summary of the number of occurrences of each category.

### Mode
- Identifies the most frequently occurring category.

### Bar Chart
- Visualizes the frequency distribution of categories using bars.

### Pie Chart
- Visualizes the relative frequencies of categories as slices of a pie.

### Count Plot
- Displays the count of observations in each category using bars.

### Chi-square Test of Independence
- Determines significant associations between categorical variables.

### Cram√©r's V
- Measures the strength of association between two categorical variables.

### Entropy
- Measures the uncertainty or randomness in the categorical variable's distribution.

### Gini Index
- Measures the impurity or inequality in the categorical variable's distribution.

### Fisher's Exact Test
- Determines significant associations between two categorical variables, suitable for small sample sizes.

### McNemar's Test
- Determines significant changes in proportions between two related categorical variables.

### Bhattacharyya Coefficient
- Measures the similarity between two categorical distributions.

### G-test
- Compares the fit of observed frequencies to expected frequencies in contingency tables.
