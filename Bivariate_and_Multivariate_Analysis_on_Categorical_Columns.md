# Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis on Categorical Columns

This section focuses on conducting bivariate and multivariate analysis on datasets with categorical variables.

### Chi-Square Test of Independence
- Determines the association between two categorical variables.

### Contingency Table Analysis
- Constructs contingency tables to visualize relationships between categorical variables and calculate relevant statistics.

### Cram√©r's V
- Measures the strength of association between two categorical variables.

### Point-Biserial Correlation
- Measures the correlation between one binary and one continuous variable.

### Spearman's Rank Correlation
- Assesses the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two ordinal variables.

### Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)
- Explores relationships among multiple categorical variables simultaneously.

### KMeans
- Performs clustering analysis to group observations based on similarities in their categorical variable profiles.

### Logistic Regression
- Models the relationship between a binary outcome variable and multiple categorical predictor variables.

### Multinomial Logistic Regression
- Extends logistic regression to handle multinomial outcome variables with more than two categories.
