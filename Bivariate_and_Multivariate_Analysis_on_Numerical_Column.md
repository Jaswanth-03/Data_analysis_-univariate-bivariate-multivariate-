# Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis on Numerical Column

This section focuses on conducting bivariate and multivariate analysis on numerical columns.

### Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Spearman Rank-Order Correlation
- Measures the linear or monotonic association between two continuous variables.

### Kendall correlation coefficient
- Measures the ordinal relationship between two continuous variables.

### Simple Linear Regression
- Models the relationship between one dependent variable and one independent variable.

### T-test
- Compares means between two groups for each pair of numerical variables.

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving most of its variance.

### Factor Analysis
- Identifies latent factors underlying the relationships between numerical variables.

### Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
- Identifies linear combinations of variables that have maximum correlation with each other.

### K-means Clustering
- Groups observations based on similarities in their numerical variable profiles.

### Hierarchical Clustering
- Groups observations into a hierarchy of clusters based on their numerical variable profiles.

### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Identifies linear combinations of variables that best separate two or more classes.

### Plotting in 3D
- Visualizes the relationship between three numerical variables in a three-dimensional plot.

### Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
- Compares means between more than two groups for multiple numerical variables simultaneously.
