# Univariate Analysis on Numerical Column

This repository contains a Colab notebook focusing on univariate analysis for numerical columns.

## Descriptive Statistics
- Provides summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, etc.

## Histogram
- Visualizes the distribution of data using bins.

## Density Plot
- Shows the probability density function of the data.

## Box Plot
- Displays the distribution of the data's quartiles.

## Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
- Estimates the probability density function of a continuous random variable.

## Violin Plot
- Combines a box plot with the density estimation.

## Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF)
- Visualizes the cumulative distribution function of the data.

## Q-Q Plot (Quantile-Quantile Plot)
- Compares the quantiles of the data with those of a specified distribution.

## Run Sequence Plot
- Displays the data points in sequence to identify trends or patterns.

## Normality Tests
- Shapiro-Wilk Test: Tests for normality using sample data.
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test: Tests for normality based on the empirical distribution function.
- Anderson-Darling Test: Tests for normality with emphasis on the tails of the distribution.

## Parametric Tests
- t-test: Compares means between two groups.
- One-way ANOVA: Compares means between more than two groups.
- Paired t-test: Compares means of paired samples.

## Non-parametric Tests
- Mann-Whitney U Test: Non-parametric alternative to the t-test.
- Kruskal-Wallis H Test: Non-parametric alternative to ANOVA.
- Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test: Non-parametric alternative to paired t-test.

## Correlation Tests
- Pearson correlation coefficient: Measures linear correlation between two variables.
- Spearman correlation coefficient: Measures monotonic correlation between two variables.
- Kendall correlation coefficient: Measures ordinal correlation between two variables.

## Outlier Detection
- Z-score method
- Modified Z-score method
- IQR method

## Distribution Fitting
- Fits the data to different probability distributions and assesses goodness-of-fit.

## Jarque-Bera Test for Normality
- Tests for normality based on skewness and kurtosis.

The main intention behind curating this repository is to illustrate my adeptness and proficiency in the aforementioned topics.
